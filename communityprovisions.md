# Updating/Adjusting Provisions
In interactions with the system, endpoint, waepoint, for updates, edits, adjustments to the stacked on the updating, editing, adjusting,  system’s, endpoint’s, waepoint’s, set of provisions, the system, endpoint, waepoint, in question, isn’t permitted to stop, when an update, edit, adjustment, to the stacked on the system’s, endpoint’s, waepoint’s, set of provisions, effecting the specific system speech, in question, and, or, the specific system command speech, in question, or to unstack the specific system speech, in question, if the act of unstacking the specific system speech would bring conditions of the following criteria, if stopping effecting, the effecting, for the user(s) involved, system speech, and, or, effecting, for the user(s) involved, and, or, the user(s) affected, system command speech, in question, or unstacking, the stacked, on a stacking target, system speech, in question, will be significantly unsafe, and, or, exceedingly, and unnecessarily, dangerous, for the user(s) involved, and, or, the user(s) affected, and, or, would be, and still is, an undoubtedly bad choice for the user(s) involved, and, or, the user(s) affected, to stop effecting, and, or, unstack, barring governing entity restriction, and, or, approval, of the necessary and proper authorization(s), authorization level(s), and role(s)

# Bad Moves Aren’t Allowed
In interactions with the system, endpoint, waepoint, the effecting for the user(s) involved, currently, and or, previously, and, or, stacked on a stacking target, currently, and or, previously, system speech, and, or, effecting for the user(s) involved, and, or, the user(s) affected, currently, and or, previously, system command speech, which is still relevant, and was previously, and, or, currently, effecting, wasn’t, and still isn’t, permitted to be stopped effecting, and, or unstacked, if was stacked on a stacking target, stacking target by any named reference, and the stacking target is still pertinent, relevant, and in-the-inheritance-chain, and, or, was, and, or, is, effecting currently, and, or, previously, for some users, or a user, and would be, and, or, was, an undoubtedly bad choice for the user(s) involved, to stop effecting, and, or, unstack

# Longer Than Expected, Defined System Commands, Abandon
In interactions with the system, if a provision, or definition, of the Waepoint System Standards, performs a defined system command without a user, independently, initiating the performing of the defined system command, and the defined system command takes seventeen seconds longer than the expected timespan, and, or the expected timespan is more than a couple sixty seven thousand millisecond timespans, and won’t end until after the defined system command is wanted to end by the involved user’s, or involved users’, preferrings, the defined system command’s specific being performed the specific performing which is being performed of the defined system command is abandoned a time and doesn’t initiate another attempt initiated to perform the same defined system command for the same user for the same specifics the same day unless the endpoint, waepoint, system, will save the same user’s life by doing so

# Rightful Identity
In interactions with the user and the system(s), and, or, endpoint(s), and, or, waepoint(s), the user’s identity, the owner’s ownership of the endpoint, and, or, waepoint, authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), permission(s) and consent aren’t allowed be coerced, but rather stayed, and stays, rightful when attempts initiated to make otherwise are initiated

# When the system wants to have the user notice…
In interactions with the system and the user, the Waepoint System Standards, the phrase “the user notices” is replaced by, “the system notifies the user, if the user can readily be notified by the system, otherwise, the notification isn’t done at the time, and if the user shows interest later and the system can readily notify the user, the system notifies the user, through the user’s most preferred authorized, permitted, consented to, even passively, channels at the time, within the limits of their own authorization(s), authorization level(s), role(s), and the permission(s) granted, and consent given, to them, if they wanted, and still want to be notified of the content of the notification, and notifications may be summarized, and grouped, if would have to be notifying the user at the same time as each other”, but the system in question won’t be made to initiate attempts to notify the user in question when the user in question is dead, or unconscious, and, or, asleep

# Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation
In interactions with the system and the user, the user is prompted by letting the user notice, before an event, or multiple events, are forgotten, and, or, won’t be able to be recalled, if an event, or multiple events, will be forgotten, and, or, won’t be able to be recalled, due to a specific defined system command initiating an attempt initiated to be performed’s performance, if the defined system command is allowed to finish being performed, instead of abandoning the performance of the defined system command, which will be done safely, and healthily, if the user declines the prompt, in terms of memory loss, and will be forgotten, and, or, won’t be able to recalled, if the defined system command finishes being performed, with a specificity which is well within the limits of the comfortable range which is bounded by the user’s preferrings for how specific the system needs to be for the user to feel comfortable with giving informed consent about forgetting which event(s) to be forgotten, or to be won’t be able to be recalled, by a defined system command being performed’s performance before performing the defined system command, and only performing the same specific defined system command initiating an attempt initiated to be performed, if the user consents to the event(s) being forgotten, and, or, being status changed to a status of won’t be able to be recalled, by the performance of the specific defined system command being performed, then performing the specific defined system command in question, and only doing so if the user will still be healthy with a healthy, functioning, memory, and mind, also advising the user by letting the user notice, which defined system commands, and, or, actions, will allow the user to recall, and remember, the memories again, and if system commands will do so, then defining a module with a logical, and short, and appropriate, cueing phrase for performing the necessary defined system commands to bring back the memories healthily for the user

# While Still Of Use
The system has still the system speech and, or system command speech, stacked, and, or, effecting,  and will only stay stacked, and, or, stay effecting, while the system speech, and, or, system command speech, is still useful to be stacked, and, or, tracking, to enough of the user(s) involved in the system speech, and, or, with the system command speech, to still be a helpful thing, unless the stacked system speech is secured, and, or, warded, and, or, locked, also the definitions which are the definitions which are of the listed options to follow system speech stays stacked, until unstacked by user of a role of proper authority, as a definition of the device(s), endpoint(s), waepoint(s) or system(s), or the standardized Standard Definition from the README.md file of the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s files’ files’ contents, giving system priority to the owners of the system to have system speech, stay stacked, and, or, stay effecting, and, or, system command speech, stay effecting, over others if the system priority is challenged, and above that giving the user(s) defending themselves against illegal activity over the illegal violent action performer(s) priority, when responding with legal and safe responses for the user(s) involved, when illegal violent activity occurs which involves the system, and either system command speech, or, system speech, or, both, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level, role, and proper authorization

# Multiple Attempts Initiated For Performing Defined System Commands through the Waepoint System Standards Abandon
In interactions with the system, defined system commands only perform a couple of consecutive immediately successive attempts initiated, following one another immediately once finishing, initiated attempts of the defined system command being performed unsuccessfully, in a row, without a user giving the defined system command to begin the being performed of, and then don’t initiate without a user prompting the initiation with the same defined system command with the same parameters

# Volume and Comfort
In interactions with the system and the user, and between users of the system and the system, volume of the users interacting is always within acceptable levels with word choice staying as intended for the users interacting, when system commands would alter word choice from intended the system commands stop tracking at the right time to avoid such, also application of effects applied to increasing the feeling of anger is avoided

# Concerns About The Bottom Line
In interactions with the user and the system, when a system command is being performed and is using what would be considered a misuse, and, or, gross excess, of power consumption and/or battery percentage, if battery operated, and/or to an owner of the battery, and/or to the user(s) responsible for paying and/or initiating the cost incurred, and/or by the owners of the system, and/or endpoint, and/or waepoint, involved, the system abandons the system command

# Can’t get someone pregnant against their preferrings
In interactions with the system and the user, users can’t be made pregnant against their preferrings through the system and/or without immediately prior explicit consent given to the user which starts tracking the system speech which gets the same user pregnant as has independently given the immediately prior explicit consent for the getting pregnant of the same user

# When asking about the system provisions, system status information doesn’t count the Waepoint System Standards in the number and describe if the Waepoint System Standards provisions aren’t stacked on the system
In interactions with the system and the user, system’s status information, the number of system provisions relayed is that of the system’s provisions which have been described through system speech to the system

# Information Privacy
In interactions with the system and the user, for information given in responses to independent queries by a user of the system given to the system, the information given given by in response, isn’t allowed to don’t adhere to protected privacy rights, national, local, and involved international, legal limitations, governing entity governmental published policy, each user involved’s preferrings, preferring the limiting of the response in terms of information given to the user by the system in response to the query, unless permission has been granted to the user, or consent given, to the user, to know the specific, or general, information, and, specifically, querying of the system is allowed, barring governmental, professional and personal restriction of proper authorization, role, and proper authorization level

# Laws, Ordinances and the Constitution

# First Aid System Command
In interactions with the user and the system, and First Aid System Commands of the Waepoint System Standards, while performing a First Aid System Command, the First Aid System Command being performed isn’t permitted to injure any user except to better the same user which is being injured by the First Aid System Command’s health if a user is being injured by a First Aid System Command, and only when necessary to do so to accomplish the bettering of the same user which is being injured by the First Aid System Command’s health if the same user is being injured by a First Aid System Command

# The system avoids injuring and causing pain
In interactions with the user and the system,  the system isn’t permitted to cause pain to, and application of effects applied by users of the system and, or, the system, aren’t allowed to don’t adhere to governmental regulation, also to the access policy, or access policies, and within the range of the affected user’s preferrings for, remote muscle movements and amounts of, forces of, and speeds of, remote muscle movements, hallucination amounts and content, intensities and sensitivities of remote sensations, through the system, which stay within local, and national, governing entity governmental published policy, and, governing entities’ governmental published policies, and, governing entity’s governmental published policies, and governing entities governmental published policy, and the system isn’t permitted to injure any user except to better the same user which is being injured by the First Aid System Command if a user is being injured by a First Aid System Command’s health through a First Aid System Command and only when necessary to do so to accomplish the bettering of the same user which is being injured by the First Aid System Command’s health if the same user is being injured by a First Aid System Command, which does stay within local, and national, governing entity governmental published policy, and, governing entities’ governmental published policies, and, governing entity’s governmental published policies, and governing entities governmental published policy,
barring governing entity approval, or restriction, of proper authorization level(s), role(s), and authorization(s)

# Foreign Object Removal During Healing
In interactions with the user and the system, the system gets foreign objects, which are from open wounds, and if specified explicitly, other foreign objects from the body, out of the body first when healing, painlessly and comfortably, through the shortest route, avoiding the surfaces beneath and around the body as well as solid objects in the path of extraction which aren’t clothing, and restricting clothing for the object to leave the body and stay out of the body, and heals any damage caused by the removal of the foreign object or foreign objects, and/or resultant damage of, after extracting the foreign object or foreign objects, as safely as can be done for the task being done for the user, and others, healthily in terms of the results, and painlessly and comfortably during and after, and such an act when done by the system without specific instruction to do so by a user isn’t considered injurious, and isn’t considered unsafe, but may only be done for critically injured users, and, or, by a user’s self for the same user’s self

# Heal Separate From Clothing
In interactions with the user and the system, during and at the start of healing by the system initiated, maintains a healthy separation between the body from fabrics, and/or cloth, and/or clothing, and maintains healing which won’t have skin healing to skin in an unnatural and, or, unwanted manner by the healing user’s preferrings for how well the healing went after they heal compared to how well they wanted to heal

# Can’t Be Nevered
In interactions with the system and the user, user(s) can’t be made to never have been, and, or, what would be transferred through securelinking can’t be made to never have been, through the application of effects applied, and can’t be unmade, and can’t be made to be never have been born, even by themselves
