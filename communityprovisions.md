# Longer Than Expected Reserved Defined Sysyem Commands Abandon
In interactions with the endpoint, waepoint, system, if a provision, or definition, of the Waepoint System Standards, performs a reserved defined system command without a user initiating the performing of the reserved defined system command, and the reserved defined system command takes a couple of minutes longer than the expected timespan, and, or the expected timespan is more than a couple sixty seven thousand millisecond timespans, and won’t end until after wanted to end by the involved user’s, or involved users’, preferrings, the reserved defined system command’s specific being performed the specific performing which is being performed of the reserved defined system command is abandoned a time and doesn’t initiate another attempt initiated to perform the same reserved defined system command for the same user for the same specifics the same day unless the endpoint, waepoint, system, will save the same user’s life by doing so

# Rightful Identity
In interactions with the users and/or user involving the system(s), endpoint(s), waepoint(s), identity, ownership, authorization, authorization level, role, permission and consent can’t be coerced, and stayed, and stays, rightful when attempts otherwise are initiated

# When the system wants to have the user notice…
In the Waepoint System Standards, the phrase “the user notices” is replaced by, “the user tells themselves out of their own mouth”, or if impractical to do so or more welcome to don’t be noticing by way of their mouth, notices by the best and most preferred and appropriate legal, healthy and safe and comfortable way for the user at the time, within the user’s preferrings, or the user skips noticing the particular thing, the specific time being attempt initiated, and if the user would still prefer to be notified at a later time, the user notices with the above criteria for limitation of when and how to they will, if they do, if they still prefer to at the time, what the user was going to notice earlier if still applicable the first good opportunity the system gets to notify the user and lets the user notice, with the above criteria for limitation of when and how to they will, what they were going to at the earlier time when the attempt was initiated if the information is still pertinent and wanted to know of by the user according to the user’s preferrings at the present time

# Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation
If a single memory of an event or a number of memories of of an event or events will be affected or forgotten by use of the system for the affected user or users, the default choice when such would occur is to only have forgotten or affected the the memories which won’t be thought about by the user or the users individually or referred to by another user, other users, either of the two, later and now in the users’ affected individually’s lifetimes, the user or affected users individually are prompted through noticing with the option to do so at the time, and if the prompt is declined, the system abandons the system interaction which would affect the user or cause the user to forget the memory or memories of the event or the number of events, or if the prompt is approved then additionally, the user is prompted through noticing if the user should use the Restore… First Aid System Command to bring back the memories if and when they want to and whether there either aren’t, are, which of the two, additional Defined System Commands or a Defined System Command needed to be performed to keep the memories after and what the additional needed to be performed to keep the memories after are, if there are any, and if the prompt is declined or approved the system proceeds accordingly, and when healing attempts are initiated for different ages, memory and brain structure and content is only interacted with through the system by the Individual Event Memory Loss and Preservation provision’s provisions relative to the user’s current experiential age versus the user’s desired age in body, though memory interactions, being made to forget an event and memory preservation through the system isn’t able to be left unhealthy at the end of the interaction, but must leave the user stable, healthy, and with the user’s best level of cognitive faculty achievable by the system and the users affected individually in the interaction and an unquestionably well working mind and a well working memory, mind and body with the changes to the user’s memory explicitly and/or intrinsically determined by the user which can be done with the user being stable, healthy, cognizant and with the users desired, essential, and the memories which will come to the user’s thoughts now or later in life or be referred to to the user by other users or the user’s self in life, retained and accessible, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level, role and proper authorization

# While Still Of Use
The system has still the system speech stacked, and, or, tracking,  and will only stay stacked, and, or, stay tracking, while the system speech is still useful to be stacked, and, or, tracking, to the user(s) involved, unless the stacked system speech is secured, and, or, warded, and, or, locked, also the definitions which are the definitions which are of the listed options to follow system speech stays stacked, until unstacked by user of a role of proper authority, as a definition of the device(s), endpoint(s), waepoint(s) or system(s), or the standardized Standard Definition from the README.md file of the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s files, giving system priority to the owners of the system to have system speech, stay stacked, and, or, stay tracking, and, or, system command speech, stay tracking, over others if the system priority is challenged, and above that giving the user(s) defending themselves against illegal activity over the illegal violent action performers when illegal violent activity occurs which involves the system, and either system command speech, or, system speech, or, both, barring governing entity approval or restriction of proper authorization level, role, and proper authorization

# Volume and Comfort
In interactions with the system, devices, mapping, users, volume and comfort of the users interacting are always within acceptable levels with word choice staying as intended for the users interacting, when system commands would alter word choice from intended the system commands stop tracking at the right time to avoid such, also application of modephases applied to increasing the feeling of anger is avoided

# Concerns About The Bottom Line
In interactions with the user or users and the system, when a system command is being performed and is using what would be considered a misuse or gross excess of power consumption and/or battery percentage, if battery operated, and/or to the owner of the battery, and/or to the user(s) responsible for paying and/or initiating the cost incurred, and/or by the owners of the system, segment(s), and/or device(s) involved, the system abandons the system command
