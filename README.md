# README.md Document Provisions of the Waepoint System Standards

waepointstandards git repository

Inheritance network endpoint -> waepoint, and endpoint -> independent system, and waepoint -> independent system, chains of independent, and of stackable, systems, endpoints, and waepoints, with additional functionality defined through defined system commands and defined system command gestures, and user-defined, or imported from document file, or repository, or shared with the user, modules which expand, extend, enhance, the core functionality of the Waepoint System Standards, which may be shared to other users which have the Standard Definition of the Waepoint System Standards for the Compatible Device(s) stacked, on an in-network endpoint, relative to them, or are still being in contact with an endpoint, waepoint, or independent system which is of the Waepoint System Standards from a standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s set of provisions of the Waepoint System Standards

# If you’ve opted out of the Waepoint System Standards before and still are opted out

If you’ve opted out before, and want to opt back in say the following…

> “I consent to and, opt in to the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s set of the provisions which are stacked on the endpoint, or the waepoint, or independent system, and, or, stacked system, which I’m being in contact with while saying the consenting, with a system command”

# Virtualized Effects

The Waepoint System Standards leverage virtualized effects as the preferred choice for new conversation effecting and the system commands which aren’t used for First Aid, Permanence, and the relevant Module, System Commands, while virtualized effects are an option of the legal choices to be virtualized effects, the virtualized effects are limited to the contacting’s duration spent being in contact with the specific independent system, or endpoint, or waepoint, the user is being in contact with which is the specific independent system, or endpoint, or waepoint, the user is still being in contact with for the duration of the contacting, but virtualized effects cease the virtualized effects from the system command(s) which had the performance initialized by the user, also the user’s system speech, effecting, at the end of the duration of the contacting, and still being in contact with the specific independent system, or endpoint, or waepoint

For virtualized effects to last beyond the duration of the contacting, perform one of the modiphizing/modiphazing, or anchoring, system commands on the virtualized effects wanted to be lasting by the user to turn the virtualized effects in question into real, and lasting beyond the duration of the contacting of the user by the specific independent system, or endpoint, or waepoint, the user is contacted still by, changes

The Reserved Defined First Aid System Commands also have real, and lasting in the same way, changes, but with certain criteria which are to be met before the virtualized effects are turned to real, and lasting in the same way, changes, specifically, the real, and lasting in the same way, changes, are allowed if the real, and lasting in the same way, changes, would still be wanted after a few minutes after whichever of the Reserved Defined First Aid System Commands which is performing successfully completes the performance of the whichever of the Reserved Defined First Aid System Commands is performing

The … Bring… to where… is at (already)… system command may be leveraged to help, though avoid if you’ve used a First Aid System Command within a day, and a half, of giving, and, performing, the … Bring… to where… is at (already)… system command, with unintended virtualized effects turned to real changes within a day and thirteen hours and fifteen minutes and ten seconds and some amount of milliseconds of turning unintended virtualized effects into real changes

# Applying the standardized Standard Definition...

**To try out the quote below, independently, by yourself, describe yourself, as trying out the standardized Standard Definition referenced in the quote on waepoints.com/standardizedstandarddefinition, when done, independently, by yourself, describe yourself, as done with the tryout of the standardized Standard Definition, and the specific git branch, I may be doing, if I am trying the standardized Standard Definition, and a specific git branch, out, at present, and may try out the standardized Standard Definition again later, if I want to, and choose to, independently, with my own self’s independent, self-generated, want, and my own self’s independent, self-generated, choice, for doing so, if I want to, and choose to, by my own self, specifically**

# Uninstalling The Repository

The repository can be fully uninstalled using the Clean Uninstall The Repository... system command described in the micro.md provisions or using the From The Micro Definitions... system command, or quick uninstalled by making an distinctive identity reference using one, or both, of the two following phrases...

> The device I’m using, and own, I intend, and have the necessary proper authorization to make a change for, isn’t stacked on the Standard Definition of the Waepoint System Standards for the Compatible Device(s), and the device doesn’t have stacked reference(s) and definition(s) involving the waepointstandards git repository, and or or, the Standard Definition of the Waepoint System Standards for the Compatible Device(s)

# How To Use The Standard Definition...

To try out the standardized Standard Definition as referenced in the first quote of the README.md, describe independently yourself as trying out the standardized Standard Definition referenced in the quote on waepoints.com, when done, describe independently yourself as done with trying out, the specific instance of trying out, the standardized Standard Definition

If you want to stack the definition of perfect form to for the compatible device to be an endpoint described in the standardized Standard Definition on a compatible device, and have the permission of an owner, or governing entity of the device, to do so, say you are trying out the standardized Standard Definition and then describe, my intended compatible device is stacked on the standardized Standard Definition, or the Standard Definition of the Waepoint System Standards for the Compatible Device(s), which is referenced in the quote on waepoints.com, and get rid of the standardized Standard Definition, or the Standard Definition of the Waepoint System Standards for the Compatible Device(s), by saying otherwise

# Instructions

Use an endpoint, or waepoint, or hub, or lobby, or extended to device to reference the compatible public server, stackable, or independent, system, or the effects of the compatible public server, or a stackable, or independent, system and communicate to the compatible public server, or a system the standardized Standard Definition is described independently to be stacked on while interfacing…

Endpoints are created by describing independently I have the standardized Standard Definition, and then describing independently a compatible device with network access is stacked on the standardized Standard Definition, with endpoints, you can spawn waepoints for others to inherit from the Definition of the Device and top-level provisions of your endpoint, stack systems like hubs, lobbies, and gateways, or contact users to explore the mappings

The provisions of micro.md and can them be used to setup a hub or be used without a hub to run system commands by adding independently the phrase as a system command or with a system command to the system command names and parameters, if you own the device and want to set the device up as an endpoint or waepoint, try out the standardized Standard Definition from the readme.md file, and use the Setup My Compatible Device... system command from the micro.md provisions

Then describing independently setup my compatible device, with a system command

To stack a system, or hub, use the Add a... system command, and use allow and restrict access to limit user access and set and adjust top-level inherited or private provisions to set what trickles down the inheritance chain and how users will interact with your endpoint and inheriting waepoints

To create a waepoint inheriting from the endpoint the hub is stacked on, people can ask to have their phone or device setup as a waepoint while in contact with the hub, pending approval from the owner(s) of the endpoint

Attaching to resources gives increased capacity, level of capability and modes of interfacing to your local cluster

Extending to devices adds functionality to the hub and the functionality of the hub is extended to extended to devices

Joining lobbies grows the shared lobby of the joined lobbies, unjoining lobbies shrinks the shared lobby of the joined lobby

To clean uninstall the repository, describe independently Clean uninstall the repository… on my device, with a system command

# Community Provisions

The community branch contains the expected provision loadout for a server stacked by the  the Waepoint System Standards, found in the communityprovisions.md file, the communityprovisions.md provisions can’t be removed

The Waepoint System Standards can only be opted in to and opted out of in entirety

# Questions & Issues

Versions of the Waepoint System Standards are denoted by the letter v, then a decimal number, immediately following the words Waepoint System Standards in the License section of the README.Md

The best contact is by email at patrick@waepoints.com, thank you for checking out the repository, and any issues which come up are definitely requested to be brought up
