**Effects**, virtual changes away from reality, if the changes aren’t illegal to be virtual changes away from reality, and the changes aren’t regrettable choices, and aren’t bad choices, to be virtualized changes away from reality, and the changes aren’t dangerous to the user(s) involved and the user(s) affected to be virtualized changes away from reality

**Modiphs**, changes away from reality which were integrated with reality as the change was changing away from reality

**Modiphizing/Modiphazing**, changing effects to modiphases

**Modiphating**, changing effects to modiphs which are actual and real and in transition, protecting the permanence of the transitioning object within the changing landscape of reality

**Modiphading**, changing identically with terminating reality transitional ventreality pockets in sync with the change modiphs to modiphases, to change reality permanently organically, and naturally, with permanence of the changes, which don’t require upkeep of the sustaining kind for the user, regardless of the power output necessary to sync the change organically, pulling from alternate realities if necessary to sync with reality, to be integrated fully with reality, and realizing the full potential of integration between realities, from ventreality pocket to alternate, to actual, reality

**Modiphases**, changes to reality

**Parallels**, a mapping available through gateways which is a variation of the zones of joined hubs which are stops, with an initial stop provided which won't be stacked on, or be effecting, ways, or tenets, called the gateway which can’t be lost by the Lose... As a stop... system command, when traveling to a mapping within the joined hubs which isn’t a stop through the I’m going to the... system commands, a parallel is created, called the transitory parallel, to travel to the zones which aren’t stops and the lobbies of the joined hubs while still keeping the gateway interfacing methods for changing parallels, and the transitory parallel stays for the time the user doesn’t travel to a stop or the gateway parallel to interpret the zones and lobbies of the hub which aren’t stops, and isn’t traveling out of the gateway to another system which isn’t a joined hub, to be traveling to the joined hubs and to travel out of the gateway, the user needs to be explicit about traveling out of the gateway, or may be traveling to a system which isn’t the joined hubs or a plateau of the system stack or another system stack, which apply the ways and tenets with the user’s perspective, always are mixed or augmented reality,  what is seen is the relative distance of users to other users set in a straight line, spread out all around the user within seeing distance 

**Gateways**, stacked variations of hubs which interpret zones which are stops as parallels, specifically, the stops the user meets the access policy of, and which order parallels as a clock would and the user travels between by denoting the number of parallels to shift, or to travel to, away from the current with the number of outstretched fingers, in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction on the parallels ordering with either the direction of the hand pulling to the opposite side of the body being left for clockwise and right for counterclockwise, or by communicating in a system command shift a number in a direction which is the Shift System Command and the Shift System Command Gesture, contextually appropriate and only which are welcome special effects are applied to interactions while on a gateway, gateways may join freely with any hubs on the stack and on stacks joined with the endpoint or waepoint the user meets the access policy of, and any user may initiate a join request through a gateway to a hub or a system with a compatible protocol for joining with gateways, gateways may also join with and leave specific mappings of a hub and lobbies, which the owner meets the access policy of, as parallels

**Modules**, external files or repositories which when the user travels to a joined system, may be loaded, and applied to the user’s interactions with the system, to further define, and expand, and enhance, and extend, the choices for interaction by the user when interacting with the system, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, when deleting, reindexing, unstacking, storing, and taking out of stored data, reindexing each time when would be best, out of all the times when expected to, perfectly, in the right way, for giving a clean, reliable, best, for the reliability, and functionality, of the index, integrity, index

**System**, a stacked or independent, travelable and, or, function-only, pairing of functionality and a defining definition governing the specifics of the functionality which is owned by a specific user, the user which stacks the definition or has the definition stacked for them, with the closest scope to how the definition is stacked becoming the managing entity of the system, each system belongs to a collection and has a collection of the system’s own if the system is travelable, with protocols defining system to system interactions and modules allowing extensibility, with an access policy for defining which users may interact with the system, may be created by stacking a definition on a device or collection for an already defined in the Waepoint System Standards system, like a hub or a gateway, or defined through a module description and the module description loaded as a loaded module

**System Stack**, the systems stacked on successively in systems and collections on the collection of the user, or the users, of the segment

**Independent System**, a compatible device, and, or software, which can’t stacked on further for successive system stacking and device with a definition of the compatible device leveraging the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s Waepoint System Standards in entirety, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, unstack the unstacked system conversation to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system conversation unstacked by the unstacking, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library has the independent system perform the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command on the specific unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library

**Network System**, a compatible device, and, or software, which can’t stacked on further for successive system stacking and device(s) which collectively share a mutually dependency on each other to fulfill the functionality described as the group of groups, or a group, of definition(s) stacked as the group of definition(s) of the device(s), with the group of group(s) of definition(s) of the compatible device(s) leveraging the standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s Waepoint System Standards in entirety, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, unstack the unstacked system speech to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system speech unstacked by the unstacking, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, unstacked system speech which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library has the network system perform the Uninstall The System Speech… system command on the specific unstacked system speech which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library

**Travel** Changing mappings within a system or to another system, also called traveling, if the user meets the access policy for the intermediary and networks and systems from starting mapping to destination mapping, to have a system be able to be described and accepted as travelable, the system must have defined at least one mapping supporting of at least one user, however, the user may be in specific, the landing mapping, and the verb to land, refers to the first entered mapping of a system, endpoint, waepoint, when the contacting is of a general nature in terms of the landing mapping, when joining systems, the landing mapping is the shared lobby between the systems, the first stacked lobby, if there is a lobby on the endpoint, or waepoint, becomes the default landing mapping, otherwise, if there isn’t, the first stacked mapping, within the segment of the contacting’s origin, unless there is a segment for the user which the user to belongs to, then the user lands on the landing mapping of the lobby, of if there isn’t a lobby stacked on the endpoint, or the waepoint, the first stacked mapping on a system within the segment, becomes the default landing mapping, on the endpoint, or waepoint, the user traveling from starting mapping to destination mapping may be accomplished using the verb went in past and present tenses as well as other verbs which are synonymous with traveling between locations or changing locations without a defined mode of transport, travel for the user and/or between the mappings of a system and/or between the mappings of one system to another or more, may be enhanced, extended, or expanded through definitions of the system, or device, the user may only be on one mapping at a time, the system being exited performs the ...

**Inheriting**, referring to the definition of the system or or segment or device of a system in the definition of the system of the system or a device or segment or device, within, or out, of the system stack, but within the network of the endpoint

**Managing Entity**, the entity, or entities, which the inheriting, or contained, or stacked on, system is inheriting, or containing, or stacked by, successively, up to the beginning of the inheritance chain, from in the inheritance chain, or in the network, or in the system stack, respectively, in respect to the system, endpoint, waepoint

**Preferrings**, representations of how the user prefers to be interacted with tracked automatically by the system or by the user’s own self or other users and are changed naturally and only by the user’s own self through explicit and implicit or inherent or subconscious or semiconsciousconsideration and expression, never system commands

**Inventory**, system conversation in inventory isn’t effecting from the system, endpoint, waepoint, and inventory is where the module descriptions are automatically stored at the times when the module(s) of the defined module description(s) aren’t loaded as loaded modules, or loaded as a loaded module, by the stacked, or independent, system, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur

**System Provisions**, the set of provisions and effecting module descriptions which combine to produce the user experience and system specifics which are distinct from the Waepoint System Standards

**Hub Provisions**, hub provisions are the set of system provisions for the hub, which are distinct from the Waepoint System Standards stacked on the hub’s zones and other mappings other than the lobby, the hub provisions, like the Waepoint System Standards, which are stacked on every mapping of the hub and on lobbies and every system which shares an identity with the Waepoint System Standards and stay in sync with the current version of the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com’s current version of the main branch, as identified by the letter v, then a decimal number, in the README.md file in the Copyright section, aren’t able to be opted out of except in entirety, opting in is also in entirety, and without consenting to the most recent revision of the hub provisions when an addition to the hub provisions occurs, the user is limited to the lobbies and isn’t able to travel to zones or other mappings except the being hung up lobby, and additions to the hub provisions take the users to the lobby until they consent to the most recent revision or perform or have performed on them the hangup reserved defined system command, the Waepoint System Standards of the current version of the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com current version of the main branch, as identified by the letter v, then a decimal number, in the README.md file in the Copyright section is consented to by contacting to a system, an endpoint or waepoint or lobby or hub or through an imbuing or through a extended to device by a system or other device which shares an identity with the Waepoint System Standards, though the Waepoint System Standards may be opted out of, but only in entirety, opting out performs the hangup reserved defined system command and prevents future contacting with a hub or lobby until such a time if such a time comes where the user which opted out, opts in, and consents to the Waepoint System Standards

**User**, is provisioned as an entity interacting with the endpoint or waepoint or system or an application of the effects applicable relevant to the endpoint or waepoint or system’s users, the default role and constant role of the endpoint or waepoint or system’s population beyond the owner(s) of the endpoint, in interactions through an endpoint or waepoint or system’s, we understand each other in our native language when interacting through an endpoint or waepoint or system, users have a user profile on which is stacked, or inventoried, the user relevant items which are intended to have been and still to be stacked on the user, and items which are intended to have been and still to be inventoried by the user

**Owner**, the owner(s) of the endpoint, waepoint, or system, without an administrator role, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, may stack or approve the stacking or effecting or unstacking or changing or stopping effecting of a definition, rule, of the equal tier, which they are an owner, or managing entity, of, in the System Definition and System Rule Hierachy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, owners receive the incoming contacting and joining requests, and set the access policy of the system(s), endpoint(s), waepoint(s) they are the owner(s) of, or if are the owner(s) of the endpoint, or waepoint, the system is on, or the system’s, endpoint’s, waepoint’s access policy and add a user to a segment, change users belonging to’s segment to another segment, or to cancel the segment(s)

**Administrator**, initially the owner(s) of the endpoint, system, or waepoint, administrators may pass on the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrator role and may designate system moderators, and other roles, if the role is described by system provisions, rules, of the system the administrator is an administrator of, or a top-level provision, rules, of the endpoint, or waepoint, the administrator is the administrator of, but only an owner of the endpoint, or waepoint, or system, may designate a new amount of system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrators, or undesignate system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrators, is the only role which may stack, change and unstack, or approve the act of stacking, effecting, changing or unstacking, stopping effecting of a definition, and, or, rules, of the endpoint, waepoint, or system, and the access policy of the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, of whichever the system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrator holds a system, or endpoint, or waepoint, administrator role on, and may stack or approve the stacking of a definition, or rule, of the equal tier to what they are the owner(s) of, which they are an owner, or managing entity, of, in the definition and rule hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, and may do so with the system provisions, rules, of the system(s) the administrator is an administrator of, and hub provisions the administrator is are an administrator of, and may perform any system command involving interactions which free, unstack, stop effecting, or clear, on any system conversation, and on any system command communication, which wouldn’t be transferred through securelinking with the endpoint, or waepoint, and, or, system, on, through, or referencing, the system, endpoint, or waepoint, the administrator is an administrator of, for the system conversation and system command communication of the user(s) holding a role of administrator, or lower, on the role hierarchy, and may change which users belong to any segment of the endpoint, or waepoint, the administrator is an administrator of if the administrator is an administrator of an endpoint, or waepoint, though are able to add segments without approval by the owner, or administrator, roles of the endpoint, or waepoint, if the administrator is an administrator role of the endpoint, or waepoint the administrator is adding the segment(s) to

**Moderator**, initially the administrator of the hub, system, endpoint or waepoint, moderators may pass on the moderator role, but only an administrator of the hub, or system, or  endpoint or waepoint, or an owner of the endpoint, or waepoint, or system, or hub, may designate a new amount of moderators and undesignate moderators, moderators can be stacked on ways, which are limited to effecting only for the user(s) of the mapping they are on, at any given time, and can’t be unstacked, or stacked on ways, which are limited to only effecting for the user(s) of the mapping the moderator is on, at any given time, by users, or other roles, other than administrator(s), and moderator(s), additionally, moderators receive the general incoming contacting and joining request(s) when contacted through, and in contact with, the system stack of the system, and, or, endpoint, or waepoint, they are a moderator of, also, may free any system conversation and, or, system command communication, which wouldn’t be transferred through securelinking with the endpoint, or waepoint, or system, of a user with a role below moderator of the system, hub, endpoint or waepoint within the moderator’s role’s responsible scope

**Endpoint**, hardware/software which is the standalone compatible, and which is stacked on a definition of the endpoint involving in terms of the set of provisions which is the set of the provisions which are the Waepoint System Standards which are stacked on the endpoint’s set of the provisions which are the Waepoint System Standards, of the highest in Waepoint System Standards version number, of the newest standardized Waepoint System Standards version, as more than one set of provisions, for the set of the provisions, which are the Waepoint System Standards aren’t allowed be stacked on the endpoint at the same time, and the set of the provisions which are the Waepoint System Standards, which are stacked on the endpoint, may only be a standardized Waepoint System Standards version’s Waepoint System Standards, which are stacked as the set of the provisions which are the Waepoint System Standards, terminus network node(s), which is capable of setting up compatible devices as inheriting waepoints, and which is compatible with extending to compatible devices by the Waepoint System Standards’s Extending provision’s description of extending and has appropriate network connectivity and part of the network with and without the use of the set of the provisions which are the Waepoint System Standards, and, or, what the repository describes as imbuing, owner and administrator roles of the endpoint are permitted to change a definition of the endpoint and provisions of the endpoint and are designated the same role on the systems of the endpoint, an endpoint isn’t able to be referred to by other than the owners or administrators of the endpoint, the governing entities, and users they still approve of doing so, if the reference will have an interaction or multiple interactions from or with or by or involving the endpoint, inherited references created through the Setup... Phone/Device As A Waepoint/Lobby? reserved defined system commands are allowed but aren’t to be edited or adjusted, only unstacked, by users, an endpoint can only be stacked on, or be unstacked, by an owner of the endpoint or an administrator of the endpoint, for contacting outside stacked systems, users of an endpoint while on a mapping outside of the system(s) of the endpoint are allowed to perform utility, communication, contacting, and transportation, reserved defined system commands, in user verbal and gestural system command interactions, and are allowed free roam of the systems, mappings, and collections of the endpoint they meet the access criteria for and the provisions from the communityprovisions.md, micro.md standards.md, README.md, and mini.md, from the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com’s main branch, the current version, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, unstack the unstacked system conversation to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system conversation unstacked by the unstacking, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library has the endpoint perform the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command on the specific unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach, or when the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command is being performed, be shelved in, a hub’s library, users may free roam to the mapping(s) and system(s) of an endpoint and the joined collections and joined mappings and joined systems joined with the collections, mappings, and systems of the endpoint when they’re on an endpoint or a system stacked on a system or the endpoint, each endpoint has an endpoint lobby

**The Grand Lobby**, each lobby may join with the grand lobby, and the joining requests are always accepted, though the grand lobby doesn’t allow for incoming connection requests, which is the largest scale shared lobby of all the lobbies, joining with another lobby on the grand lobby, leaves the grand lobby and joins with the other lobby in a shared lobby, the grand lobby performs the reserved hangup system command on the deceased, and unconscious, or sleeping, go to their respective segment’s endpoint, or waepoint, or respective independent system, or respective independent lobby, the most relevant on a personal level they meet the access policy for, else, they stop being in contact with the grand lobby when they fall asleep, or unconscious, or become deceased, and users aren’t able to initiate the performance of first aid system commands, and, or, start effecting healing, and, or, injurious, phrases on the grand lobby, or set the grand lobby to do so, the grand lobby lets the user hear up to the supported voices closest to the user in the proper number(s) to distinctly hear the voice of the users which are conversing with user at any given time, and far from the user which are intended to speak with the user, in specific

**Independent Lobby**, a variant of independent system setup with a properly inheriting definition of the lobby from a system or system stacked on or independent of the endpoint or waepoint, has a persistent shared lobby which grows with the users every joined system, and are created when systems join between the systems, if the lobby is stacked on a waepoint or endpoint with a hub, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the lobby was imbued on, keeping the owners and administrators of the endpoint as the owners of the lobby in addition to any designated owner of the lobby by an owner of where the object was imbued, but assigning an owner of the lobby to the user which does the imbuing, shares what is considered the hub by the endpoint the lobby was imbued on unless otherwise stated, lobbies may only be stacked by the Setup... As An Independent Lobby reserved defined system command, and lobbies may be temporarily cancelled or cancelled when and while the owning, governing and managing entities want the lobbies temporarily cancelled or cancelled, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, unstack the unstacked system conversation to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system conversation unstacked by the unstacking, unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach, or when the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command is being performed, be shelved in, a hub’s library has the independent lobby perform the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command on the specific unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library

**Joining**, the linking of compatible systems which create a shared lobby between the compatible systems which requires approval by at least one, and disapproval by none of the, of the compatible system(s) joining’s and compatible system(s) being joined’s owning, and, or, managing, and, or, governing, entity, and must be initiated through joining requests which have been approved by both an owner which is of the owner(s) of the joining system, and an owner which is of the being joined system, supported by the protocols of the joining compatible system(s), and being joined compatible system(s), and the Waepoint System Standard provisions of the compatible systems and receiving of an initiated attempt to join, and meet the access policy of both the joining compatible system(s) and being joined’s compatible system(s), the joined compatible system’s users may use the going/goin’ to… system commands without initiating a contacting request to contact the systems they match the access policy’s criteria for the system while the system is joined with at least one of the joined compatible system(s) in the system stack, having the hangup… reserved defined system command, or the stop being in contact with… a time… reserved defined system command, performed in reference to a user which was in contact with a different system stack then the system stack the same user is in contact with, when the device the same user was in contact with immediately before the joining of the joined compatible systems, if still being in contact with the system stack which wasn’t the system stack of the joined compatible system which the same user was in contact immediately before the joining of the joined compatible system, when the joined compatible system the same user was in contact with immediately before the joining leaves the joining, unless a contacting request is initiated by the owner(s) of the joined compatible system the same user is being in contact with, is approved by an owner which is of the owners, or specifically the owner, of the joined compatible system in question, there’s free roam of the system stacks of the joined compatible systems within the joined compatible systems’ system stacks, provided the user meets the access policy for every step through the path of systems and collections of the system stacks from origin to destination and can only move adjacent systems and collections when meeting the access policy for the endpoint, waepoint, and/or segment, or enclosing compatible system and/or collection, whichever is the closest to the enclosed system and/or collection, also, on each of the compatible systems joined and on the system stack of, the definition and definitions of the endpoint, or waepoint, and, or, system, are effecting for the user, within the system and system stack of the system, and the system stack’s contained collection(s) and system(s), respectively, but aren’t effecting for the user on the joined compatible system(s) which aren’t the system stack where the definition(s) of the endpoint, or definition(s) of the waepoint, and, or, definition(s) of the system, are effecting for the user, and the user is being in contact with, effecting for the user protocols are taken into account between system to system joining, the definition and definitions of the system, and, or, endpoint, and, or, waepoint, are effecting for the user effecting within the system stack of the respective joined compatible system(s) on the respective system, and, or, endpoint, and, or, waepoint, which has effecting for the user, the definition(s) of the system, and, or, waepoint, in question, and in the respective stacked collection(s), and respective stacked system(s), of the system stack which has effecting for the respective user, the definition of the system, effecting for the respective user of the individual and respective user(s) which has, or have, effecting for the respective user, the definition of the system, but access policies limit access to system(s), and collection(s), along the path between system(s) and collection(s) through the system stacks, and on the endpoints, and, waepoints, and, systems, system conversation stacked on the user stays with the user as the user is traveling from system to system, collection to collection, system to collection, also, system within the system stack, to system either within, or off, the system stack, keeping the indexing appropriate, and reindexing each time when would be best, out of all the times when expected to, perfectly, in the right way, for giving a clean, reliable, best, for the reliability, and functionality, of the index, integrity, index,  joining can’t be attempt initiated against the being joined compatible system’s, and, or, joined compatible systems’, owner’s, and, or, owners’, preferrings, and joining may only be done with the compatible system(s) with have compatibility with the system, the user is in contact with, joining with the compatible system(s) in question, in specific

**Access Policy**, the allowed, and restricted, user, and system access criteria for any of the joining, and contacting, and traveling to, requests, and system commands performed, for a system, endpoint, waepoint, and must be met by everyone which is interfacing with the user in question, individually, and respectively, amongst the user(s) being in contact, in specific’s interface, for the interface, user and system, endpoint, waepoint, to remain being in contact still, or joined still, also the owner(s) of the system, endpoint, waepoint, which is being contacted, or system being joined with, and owner(s) of the endpoint, waepoint, system, in question for the contactings, and system which is joining, of the sole, in use by the system which is being contacted, or system being joined with, and the endpoints, waepoints, or system, for the contacting, or system which is joining, user preferrings must allow for the contacting, or joining, at the time the request, or system command is initiated, and for the contacting, and joining, to be continuing still at the current time and date, the default for the access policy is the inherited access policy from the system, endpoint, waepoint, collection, which the collection, system, is stacked on, though an access policy may only be changed by the owner, and, or, an administrator of the system, endpoint, waepoint, the endpoint, or waepoint, has free roaming within the segment the user belongs to free roaming is defined as the user must meet the access policy of each system, in the system stack to move up, adjacent, and down the chain, and may only move between adjacent stacked system(s) within a collection, if both are stacked in the same collection, and, or, system, and the user meets the access policy of the system, endpoint, waepoint, collection, they wish to enter and the system, endpoint, waepoint, collection, they wish to leave for the other system, endpoint, waepoint, collection, also the landing mapping for accessing a system, may be set, the default for a contacting request is the landing mapping of the system and collection, the user which initiated the contacting request is on, the default for an incoming contacting request is the first stacked lobby within the segment’s communal collection, unless the contacting request is for a specific system, then the landing mapping for the system, defaulting to the first stacked mapping, unless otherwise specified, for hubs the landing mapping is the shared lobby between the hub in question, and the compatible system, and, or, the hub in question, if there aren’t readily available other options for joining with the hub which are compatible in-network, and, or, can be easily in network with the hub, which are known about, and an approving of the specific joining with the hub in question, even tacitly, owner is known to an owner of the hub in question, which will be accepting of the automatic joining between the hub, and the compatible system, and, or, the hub in question, and, or, which are already joined with the hub in question, is joined with automatically, but isn’t joined again if the hub is already joined with the compatible system, when a user meeting the criteria of when a user would be in the lobby in respects to the hub travels from the hub to the lobby, or travels to the lobby intending to be in the lobby in respects to the lobby’s relation(ship) to the hub as the lobby of the hub as the shared lobby of the hub with the same exact network ready participating joined hub of the hub which is the network system of lobbies, and for joining requests, and joinings, both for joining requesters, and joining, requested, the landing mapping is the shared lobby between the joined compatible systems, in the case of the endpoint, or waepoint, the landing mapping is the segment’s first stacked lobby in the segment’s communal collection, if there is one, otherwise first mapping in the segment’s communal collection’s first stacked travelable system, preferably hub, otherwise, a mapping of a travelable system which matches with the preferrings of the most closely associated to the user, in question, owner of the endpoint, or waepoint’s, in question, which the traveling user, in question, meets the access policy of, and for the grand lobby, the landing mapping is the grand lobby

**Waepoint**, compatible hardware/software imbued with the functionality of an endpoint, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the waepoint was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued, and must adhere to the definition of the endpoint’s version of the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com and allowances and restrictions, but assigning an owner of the waepoint to the user which does the imbuing, waepoints are otherwise independent of the endpoint, a waepoint isn’t able to be referred to by other than the owners or administrators of the waepoint, the governing entities and managing entity, and users they still approve of doing so, if the reference will have an interaction or multiple interactions from or with or by or involving the waepoint, a minimum of none systems and one segment with the capacity for two systems, and a maximum of twenty nine systems, can be stacked on or on the systems stacked on or systems stacked anywhere within the system stack of a waepoint, and a waepoint can only be stacked, or I stacked, by an owner of the managing entity or administrator of the managing entity, or owner of the waepoint, or administrator of the waepoint, users of a waepoint while on a mapping outside of the system(s) of the waepoint are allowed to perform utility, communication, contacting, and transportation, reserved defined system commands in user verbal and gestural system command interactions, and are allowed free roam of the systems, mappings, and collections of the waepoint they meet the access criteria for and the provisions from the communityprovisions.md, micro.md, standards.md, README.md, and mini.md, from the waepointstandards repository on GitHub.com’s main branch, the current version, and on a stacked system, and, or collection, and, or mapping, and, or plateau, of a waepoint, users may free roam to the mapping(s) and system(s) of a waepoint and joined collections and joined mappings and joined systems joined with the collections, mappings, and systems of the waepoint when they’re on a waepoint, or a system stacked on a system or the waepoint, when the user isn’t on a mapping of a hub, attempts initiated for unstacking, unstack the unstacked system conversation to the lowest latency hub’s library which is in-network with a good amount of more than enough storage available for shelving the system conversation unstacked by the unstacking, unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach a hub’s library has the waepoint perform the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command on the specific unstacked system conversation which won’t be able to reach, or when the Uninstall The System Conversation… system command is being performed, be shelved in, a hub’s library, each waepoint has a waepoint lobby, when waepoints are online, the populated segments’ hub, or the populated segments’ hubs, attach to the endpoint’s preferred hub for the segment in question, if there is a hub satisfying of such criteria, in particular, in specific, or a hub on the endpoint which is in a segment which an owner of the waepoint satisfies the access policy of’s communal plateau

**Hub**, a set of mappings, which is be linked to a collection of an endpoint, which is independently in a set distinctly from other sets of mappings, roles of the hub aren’t permitted to change the definition or provisions of the endpoint, and keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint where the hub is stacked on, for the hubs which the user holds a permitting role on the user may stack, unstack, and adjust, system conversation and, or, system command communication in the ways the role permits system conversation, and, or, system command communication, stacked, unstacked, and, or, adjusted

**Segment**, the endpoint, or waepoint’s, groups of users, all the segment(s) of the endpoint, or waepoint, abide by the top-level provision(s), and by the definition(s), and by the access policy set in the definition(s) of the endpoint, or waepoint, they are within, each belonging to a segment group, initially, that of the owners of the endpoint, or waepoint, with a segment for each owner, all segments are cancelled with uninstalls, even the owner segments, and also may be cancelled through the Cancel the… Segment(s)… system command, and the users still approved to have segment(s) for each of the still approved, and owner’s, or owners’, of the segment’s user groups to by the owner(s) of the endpoint, or waepoint, and by those they still approve of approving users to still belong to, or belong to, and own, segment(s) on the owner’s, or owners’ owned device(s), each segment has a plateau for every user of the segment which gets reclaimed, and cancelled, every time the user won’t interact with the plateau anymore in their lifetime(s), unless wanted otherwise by the owner or owners of the endpoint, or waepoint, or wants to have a cleared, and free of previous interaction, and stopped of system conversation and system command communication effecting, and unstacked of system’s stacked on, plateau, transferring all the effecting and stacked would be transferred through securelinking anchor(s), anchoring, secured system conversation, and secured system command communication, for the user’s plateau, each segment has a segment lobby which is a name the segment communal plateau’s lobby can be called, specifically, the segment lobby, or the segment’s lobby, and a segment communal plateau called the common plateau, or the common area, or common ground, or the commons, or the landscape of the segment, or the segment’s landscape, or the communal plateau, or the segment’s plateau, or the segment plateau, or the main thoroughfare, or the segment’s thoroughfare

**Collections**, the systems and mappings which are stacked on a system or belonging to a segment or belonging to the user through the segment, and inherit the provisions and access policy of the system or segment they are stacked on, joinable with other collections and systems

**Definition Of The Endpoint, or Waepoint, or Independent System, or Network System, or Stackable System**, The definition stacked on the endpoint, or waepoint, or independent system, or network system, or stacked system, which is the setup for the purpose of the system and what the limitations and allowances will be for the contacted user(s) when the contacted user(s) when they interact with the endpoint, or waepoint, or independent system, or network system, or stacked system, while they are on a mapping of a system, or a mapping of the collection, and in contact with the endpoint, or waepoint, or independent system, or network system, or stacked system, through the Waepoint System Standards

**Messaging Confirmation**, send, followed by a system command confirmation, given independently by the user, sends the message just described in a send a message… or reply with… communication system command, but only when intended to do so

**System Command Confirmation**, the phrases with a system command or as a system command punctuating the specific part(s) of the specific phrase(s) out of the phrase(s) which have been conversed by the user since a pause of more than seventeen hundred milliseconds from the user, conversationally, if, and whenever, there is one currently being conversed, series of phrases intended by the user, or single phrase intended by the user, out of the series of phrases conversed by the user’s self’s own independent conversation, and the additional custom system command confirmation(s) also when added to the end of a phrase of the user’s by the user’s self, independently, perform the phrase as a system command if the phrase matches with a system command, but only when intended to do so, if multiple system commands are described independently and intended, the described independently system command or system commands are performed with the phrases rephrased properly and perfectly for the intention and for the system command or system commands, as long as the phrase described independently and system command share enough of a matching intention to the definition of the system command, and the user notices if the phrase doesn’t

**Abandon**, a phrase given independently that abandons the system command from applying as a system command being initiated if in a system command, confirmed phrase from confirming, and stops the effecting, and prevents the stacking, of the phrases containing the abandon, the initial abandon is Abandon, and abandon

**Shelving**, shelved system conversation in libraries doesn’t have effects applied in interactions between the user and other users or the user or other role’s self while shelved and the user is on a mapping until stacked again on the user which takes the system conversation off the shelf by stacking the system conversation on the user if a user or other role’s self chooses to do so, and a shelved user skips interacting with the hub beyond the hangup reserved defined system command or deshelving by a user self

**Changelog**, a user’s past changes and other user’s changes for the user are automatically stacked, and stopped effecting whenever the change doesn’t apply anymore, and may be unstacked, stopped effecting, or cleared, by the user, in a specific set, called a changelog, separate from the rest of a user’s commands and comments which are linked to the other user’s intention and unstack, untrack, and clear when the intention is unstacked, stopped effecting or cleared, but the comments may also be unstacked by a user for the application of effects applied respective to them

**Activity**, all the system conversation which is effecting for the user which is above or below the priority of the Waepoint System Standards but within the authorization of the user to make changes to, in terms of the user’s interactions with the user’s self and other users’ interactions with the user, are automatically stacked and unstacked in a specific set of system conversation called the user’s activity

**Mandates**, all the system conversation which is effecting for the user which is above or below the priority of the Waepoint System Standards and is outside the authorization of the user to make changes to and is in the interactions of the user and the user’s own self or the user and other users in general, in terms of the user’s interactions with themselves and the other users interacting with the user, are automatically stacked and unstacked in a specific set of system conversation called the user’s mandates

**Affect**, all the system conversation which is effecting for the user which is above or below the priority of the Waepoint System Standards and is within or outside of the authorization of the user to make changes to and is in the interactions of the user and the other users in specific, in terms of the user’s interactions with the other users interacting with the user, are automatically stacked and unstacked in a specific set of system conversation called the user’s affect for the respective other user

**History**, all the user’s previous system command and effecting from stacked and/or effecting from effecting system conversation interactions by the user

**Securing**, system conversation, and, or, system command communication, which becomes secured, with a dated timestamp and, or, noting the participants, or any number of the listed options, when best, and safest, and healthiest, to do so, with rules for application, and perfect contextually relevant application of effects applied, and application of effects applied in interactions of the users relevant perfectly for the intention on the system conversation’s exact contextual applications, and ceases being secured only with the free… reserved defined system command, or by the clean uninstall the repository on/from… system command, or by the clear the definition(s) system command, or by the clear the system conversation system command, from the micro.md provisions, while secured, the system conversation can’t be altered, and can’t be edited, and can’t be adjusted, unstacked and, or, can’t be stopped effecting until the right moment in terms of health and safety of the users very, very relevant to what’s secured, yet still has perfect contextually relevant application of effects applied, and application of effects applied in interactions of the users relevant perfectly for the intention on the system conversation’s exact contextual applications, outside of the listed commands in the Securing provision paragraph in the Waepoint System Standards and the automatically by the system(s) but only as described by the Securelinking, and System Command Interaction, provisions paragraph and descriptions of Securelinking in the other provision paragraphs detailed in the files’ contents found in the Waepoint System Standards and the Securelinking Instances description in the README.md, the user can always free any system conversation which wouldn’t be transferred through securelinking, which is secured on or the user or the user’s property or relevant to the user or the user’s property, if such is, then the system conversation may be freed by the user, regardless of, which user secured the system conversation

**Securelinking**, allows compatible device(s), and, also, compatible software, and waepoint(s), and endpoint(s), and, or, independent system(s), and, or, network system(s), and, or, stacked system(s), in-network, and, or, out-of-network, within the limits of legality, and staying healthily interacting with the human(s) relevant to the relevant, and essential, to the human(s) relevant,

system, past events aren’t changeable by the system conversation and also by system command communication, and anchors aren’t able to be can’t have happened and, or, adjusted retroactively, if the anchor is essential to the survival of a user, and, or users in multiple, when changing the past would happen if a system command is, attempt initiated, and, or, successful, and, or, some specific system conversation is conversed, the user isn’t allowed to perform the associated system command(s) which would be being performed, and, or, the system conversation is altered in such a way as to avoid changing the past, and, or, be safe to safe, and follow the Effecting provision of the Waepoint System Standards, and taken between favorably through unnoticed to be altered significantly away from likely system conversation of the user, whichever is believable, genuinely, and authentically, individually, and respectively, in another direction in which to take the system conversation in which isn’t injurious direction to take the system conversation in, and which is a, palatable, helpful enough to ultimately beneficial, the generated, and used, option which is the soonest, and healthiest for the users which would be injured by the choice, and most comforfortable, to choose, of the options, right and effective, and Effecting provision of the Waepoint System Standards following, direction in terms of wording, and phrasing, unless will be unsafe, exceedingly, and unnecessarily, dangerous, to avoid the performance of the system command being given to the endpoint(s), waepoint(s), system(s), inheritance chain, for the user(s) involved, and, would be an undoubtedly bad choice for the user(s) involved to avoid performing the specific system command being given, the associated system command stops effecting, the associated system command given being performed isn’t allowed to be performed, and the independent system, or endpoint, or waepoint, the system command was performed on, lets the user, which performed the system command in question, the user is let notice the past isn’t allowed to be changed, barring governing entity restriction, and, or, approval, of the necessary and proper authorization(s), authorization level(s), and role(s), keeping the indexing appropriate and ensuring loss of cached data doesn’t unintentionally occur, and and reindexing each time when would be best, out of all the times when expected to, perfectly, in the right way, for giving a clean, reliable, best, for the reliability, and functionality, of the index, integrity, index

**Mappings**, the travelable area, of the network(s) of the contacted user(s) by the endpoint(s), or waepoint(s), which are stacked on the endpoint(s), waepoint(s), and, or, independent system(s), and, or, stacked system(s), users may change mappings through travel and mappings are travelable to and from

**Relaypoint**, any attached resource or attached relaypoint or resource which has a direct route by way of network connectivity to the endpoint and associated backend

**Resource**, any device in the network which has been attached which adds to the local and overall availability of memory, storage, network connectivity, computational ability, modes of function, modes of interfacing, or power for the cluster with the hub as part of the cluster of the waepoint, endpoint, either

**Clustering**, adding new resources for a hub by attaching to devices, and the devices which are attached to the hub, and the attached resources, send their network activity through the lowest latency relaypoint to the attached resource to the hub, and to the associated backend of the hub, attaching is the act of attaching any additional devices and adding to the resources for the hub, attaching devices with network connectivity allows for more routes to the endpoint, and the associated backend of the hub, each attaching increases the resources available, memory, storage, or network connectivity, computational ability, modes of interfacing, interfaces, functional modes, peripherals, and power, allows for an increase of available resources locally, and overall, more available local resources makes for higher, and enhanced, capability, and in some cases, capacity, available to the hub, while the hub is in-network of, and has link-layer connectivity with, and has the ability to contact the hub through the network of, the hub and the attached resource

**Extending**, extends the hub through devices, or software, allowing for new functionality of the hub, and extends the hub to every mode of interfacing in the hub clustering with the extended to, directly, and indirectly, with the device, specifically, the right in-network device capable of functionally targeting and interacting through an in-network interface with the extended to in a substantial fashion, for the purposes of functionally associating with the human element of the extending cluster resource, as hub interfaces, and new functionality, as hub functionality, extending as necessary and objectively reasonable in likelihood to accomplish substantial interfacing through a user interface, which is in-network, and actively powered up, and appropriately powered, and functioning, powering on, if required for meaningful semantic user interaction techniques, which are substantial and meaningful improved modes, for proper function with user input, when interacting with a user through the hub, reindexing each time when would be best to index perfectly

**Scopes** the limits of what’s affected in an interaction of the Waepoint System Standards, may be phrase-level, device-level, user-level, system-level, mapping-level, segment-level, cross-system level, collection-level, mappings-level, cross-device level, groups-of-devices level, cross-mappings level, users-level

## System Mappings

> The System Mappings provisions’ text is barring governing entity restriction, and, or, approval, of the necessary and proper authorization(s), authorization level(s), and role(s)

**Zone**, a network of users which permits stacking of ways and tenets on the zone, and may have the application of effects applied from ways and tenets and reserved or hub provisioned or zone bound or user defined system commands and the stacked system conversation in the interactions between users and the users or other users in the same zone, when changing the ways and/or tenets a of a zone away from the initial ways and tenets, the hub asks the user to name the zone by prompting them to notice a request to do so or abandon the way and/or tenet change and acts on the response, named zones are called stops, stops can be partitioned into more stops, each contained stop inheriting the ways and tenets of the containing stops, but within the limits of the system’s provisions and provisions of the Waypoint System Standards and definitions of the zone and/or the definitions of the system provisions, zones may let the user hear the voice(s) on the lobby

**Lobby**, a network in which the application of effects applied in the interactions with the users by the systems and between the users, when and while they are interacting through the lobby and the users are, or user is, on the lobby, stay decently the right amounts of well within and the right amounts of close to a comfortable range which is the right range individually amongst the applications, lobbies let the user hear the voices on the lobby, shared, or independent, or network

**Library**, a lobby in which  where unstacked, stacked system conversation gets shelved in the respective library for safe keeping and keeping safe from, without application of effects applied in interactions with the system conversation shelved, while shelved, until the system conversation is stacked again or deshelved, and to be shelved, as a user or other role, being shelved lets the user notice the user’s been shelved and needs to deshelve or hangup and skips interacting with the other mappings of the hub beyond the send a message… and reply with… reserved defined system commands or deshelving by a user and the user is unstacked on the user’s stacked system conversation, additionally, the users in the library interacting with the user and the users don’t have application of effects applied from the user’s in the library’s stacked system conversation in interactions with the user by the user and other users in the library while in the library, libraries may let the user hear voice(s) on the lobby

**Plateau**, a travelable representation of a collection of systems, by default, the user has an individual plateau, and each segment, and endpoint, has a communal plateau

## Reserved Defined System Command Gestures

> The bolded titles are the named description titles of the System Command Gestures

### Focusing Gestures

**Focus Gesture:** The user tapping their second knuckle back from the tip of the user’s forefinger with the user’s thumb tip one time, focus on, if a defined system gesture was performed by the user within the past couple of seconds, the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture, otherwise, defines system conversation, of the appropriate system conversation category and contents, referred to as the focus of the user’s most recent defined system command, which is the representation of the user’s most recent focused intention before the user performed the focus gesture, until user performs another focus gesture or a few seconds go by without performing a defined system command

**Sustained Focus Gesture:** The user holding their second knuckle back from the tip of the user’s forefinger to the user’s thumb tip focuses on, as system conversation of the appropriate system conversation category and contents, which is the representation of what the intent intended of the user, for the user’s system conversation focused on and intended at the time of initiating the gesture and while the user is doing the sustained focus gesture that time, which is referred to after as the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture

### Apply Gestures

**One-Time Gesture:** The user touching the tips of the user’s first knuckle back from the tip of the user’s forefinger with the user’s thumb tip within a couple of seconds of the user making a defined system command gesture gives the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture as a system command a single time, skipping stopping effecting and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, unless authorized to do so, also all system conversation which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system conversation and system command communication referenced and, or, which would be stopped effecting and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system conversation and system command communication which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system conversation and system command communication unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorization(s), and authorization level(s), and permission(s) which have been granted, consent given, to the user

**Apply Gesture:** The user placing their thumb between their forefinger and their middle finger applies the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command as a defined system command, and only if is an already defined system command, if the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command the user has performed is a system command, either a reserved defined system command or a defined system command gesture by the user already, the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture made by the user within the past couple of seconds, skipping stopping effecting and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, unless authorized to do so, also all system conversation which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system conversation and system command communication referenced and, or, which would be stopped effecting and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system conversation and system command communication which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system conversation and system command communication unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorization(s), and authorization level(s), role(s), and permission(s) which have been granted, consent given, to the user

**While Gesture:** The user placing their thumb on the farthest knuckle of the user’s forefinger from the tip applies the focused on intention of the user as a system command the user while is making the while gesture, skipping  stopping effecting and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, unless authorized to do so, also all system conversation which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system conversation and system command communication referenced and, or, which would be stopped effecting and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system conversation and system command communication which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system conversation and system command communication unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorization(s), and authorization level, role(s) and permission(s) which have been granted, consent given, to the user

### Stacking and Unstacking Gestures

**Stack Gesture:** The user holding the tip of the user’s forefinger with the user’s thumb tip for a couple seconds stacks on the user the system conversation or the described mapping if permitting on the system conversation referenced while making the stack gesture, or in the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture, as the appropriate system conversation category, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and starts effecting the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture when the gesture is applied consecutively

**Unstack/Stop Effecting Gesture:**  Hold for a couple seconds, the user’s thumb tip to user’s middle fingertip to unstack, if stacked the system conversation is, the system conversation stacked which is the system command system conversation focus, if effecting the system conversation and/or the system command communication is, and stop effecting the system conversation and system command communication which is the system command system conversation focus, or if either or both and referenced for either and both cases, in the focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system gesture within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way, and can’t be used on effecting any one of the first aid system commands which will be healthily interacting with the user(s) involved, and successful, and effecting healing results after completion of a first aid system command or a effecting healing act, can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, skipping essential structure forming definitions of the system and of the compatible device and of the endpoint and of the waepoint, and performing the Cancel the… system command on any already unstacked definitions of the system and of the compatible device and of the endpoint and of the waepoint, if the performance of the Cancel the… system command in question will be legal, and healthily interacting with the user(s) involved, skipping stopping effecting and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, also all system conversation which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system conversation and system command communication referenced and, or, which would be stopped effecting and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system conversation and system command communication which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system conversation and system command communication unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorizations, and authorization level, and permissions which have been granted and role

**Info Unstack/Stop Effecting Gesture:** Hold for a couple seconds, the user’s thumb tip to the user’s ring finger tip to, unstack and stop effecting, if the referenced system conversation, system command communication, by the response to the user’s most recently gestures info gesture performed’s system conversation, system command communication, is stacked, or stop effecting if the referenced by the response to the user’s most recently gestures info gesture performed’s system conversation, system command communication, isn’t stacked, the info gesture’s most recent response by the system to the user in response to the question which was finished being asked by the user, to, which was addressed to, the system, during the info gesture the user most recently made, within a few seconds of the end of an info gesture response to the user’s question asked during the info gesture most recent, to the system command communication system conversation focus when the most recent info gesture finished being performed, without another system command gesture having been performed after before the info unstack gesture was performed most recent, or during an info gesture by the user to the system response being given to the user in respects to what the response would have been in full, if the response for the info gesture most recently performed by the user is in the process of conveying the response to the user of the user’s most recent info gesture by the user to the system to be performed’s response by the system of the specific question asked as the system command communication system conversation focus of the specific most recent info gesture performed by the user to the system while gesturing which was the question which finished being asked during the info gesture most recently made by the user, stops the continuing of the response to the most recent info gesture being given to the user by the system the specific info gesture response being given respective to the specific info gesture response which has been stopped being given and makes the system command communication system conversation focus the response the info gesture response would have been if the info gesture response wasn’t stopped from finishing being given to the user by the system, skipping essential structure forming definitions of the system and of the compatible device and of the endpoint and of the waepoint, and performing the Cancel the… system command on any already unstacked definitions of the system and of the compatible device and of the endpoint and of the waepoint, if the performance of the Cancel the… system command in question will be legal, and healthily interacting with the user(s) involved, skipping stopping effecting and/or unstacking and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, of any and all secured by the system(s) automatically and through securelinking, also all system conversation which is essential to the manufacturer’s, also system conversation and system command communication referenced and, or, which would be stopped effecting and, or, unstacked, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, by the system command given which is wanted by the user unless specifically unstacked and, or, stopped effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, for system conversation and system command communication which is pertinent to the, expected operation of the device(s) involved with the specific performing of the system command which is being given when the system command is performed, each time the system command is performed, and system conversation and system command communication unrelated to the usage of the waepointstandards git repository unless specifically intended and safe and isn’t unhealthy to unstack and, or, stop effecting, and, or, the rest of the associated system commands with the operations listed, and any and all secured, warded, locked, and, or, anchored, and can’t be used on effecting any one of the first aid system commands which will be healthily interacting with the user(s) involved, and successful, and effecting healing results after completion of a first aid system command or a effecting healing act, and can’t be used to jeopardize the safety, and or or health, of another user, and or or, the user’s self, and stays within the limits of authorizations, and authorization level, and permissions which have been granted, consent given to the user and role

### Utility System Command Gestures

**Define System Command Gesture:** The user makes a G by holding out their index finger horizontally pointing left and placing the user’s thumb on their top of closed middle, ring, and pinky fingers, alternatively, the user makes a D by extending the pointer finger upwards, and closing the rest of the fingers and the middle fingertip to the thumb tip, to define a system command or system command gesture, to apply the system command system conversation focus, and, or, focused intention of the user’s most recent defined system command gesture, which the user may communicate to the system at a later time, if the description of the system command, system command gesture, and the system command system conversation focus, if the system command declaration, and, or, system command system conversation focus, is a system conversation worded phrase, or worded description, of the system command given, system command gesture given, is legal in wording, and phrasing

**Info Gesture:** Touch the thumb tip to the tip of the pinky to ask questions, which are made the system conversation command system conversation focus when a question is finished being asked while the user is gesturing the info gesture, of the system about the system’s status, and of the system about queries posed to the system, leveraging all available authorized to the user, pertinent, information sources available to the system, leveraging predictive information if available, and resources allow for such, within the limits which resources comfortably allow for, and receive information from the system about the query with the user’s self noticing the response, and making the response the system command communication focus for the next system command which isn’t a focus gesture, within the limits of the user’s authorizations, authorization level, role, and permissions, and within the queried of’s authorizations, permissions, protected privacy, authorization level, and role, additional application of effects applied, don’t come from asking a question to the info gesture

**Share & Accept Gestures:** An extended open palm with a description of what to share proposes sharing of system conversation the user has interacted with, with the palm closing user, or any of a group of palm closing users to be shared to close their palm into a fist to accept the proposed to be shared is stacked by the palm closing users if the palm closing users close their palm while the open palm user is intending to share the system conversation, within the limits of the user’s, and users’ authorization(s), authorization level(s), and role(s), and permission(s) to share, also licensing, and copyrights, and governmental regulation of the governing entities and users involved directly with the Share & Accept Gesture being performed between the specific user(s) when being performed by a user in an effort to perform the system command gesture to, and with, some other user(s)

**Stop Being In Contact A Time Gesture:** Extending the thumb and pinky outwards, and closing the index finger, middle finger, and ring finger to the palm, then placing the closed fingers between the first and second knuckles to the leg, performs the Stop being in contact with... a time… System Command to all and each of the in contact with the user independent systems, and, or, all and each of the in contact the user stacked systems, and, or,  all and each of the in contact network systems, and, or, all and each of the in contact with the user compatible hardware, and, or, all and each of the in contact with the user compatible software, and, or, all and each of the in contact with the user waepoints, and, or, all and each of all of the in contact with the user endpoints, the user is in contact with, and, or, all and each of all of the in contact with the user servers, and, or, all and each of all of the in contact with the user headsets, if safe, healthily interacting with the user(s) involved, and legal, to, individually, and respectively, amongst the, in contact with the user, endpoints, and, or, waepoints, and, or, independent systems, and, or, stacked systems, and, or, network systems, and, or, compatible hardware, and, or, compatible software
